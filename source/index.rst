Graylog Information Model Schema
================================

This guide is a reference for the schema used in Graylog Illuminate.  We will keep this updates as changes are made, but if you feel a change should be here, please open a GitHub issue HERE.

How To Use
==========

Under Contents, we have broken out the GIM Schema into groupings of fields.  For fields referencing a "file", you could go to the :ref:`file`

We have also created a section for specific vendor fields, we think were important to create, but did not fit in the GIM, so wew created a new page for them under :ref:`vendors`
